In November 2020, I gave my very first virtual tech talk! At the time, my background was a window. Since then, I became more involved with the Tech Twitter community and was inspired by all of the amazing backgrounds my role models had. Since Janaury 2021, I started transforming my bookshelf into a background that I have since shown off on Hello World, the Global AI Student Conference, and even Microsoft Build.

This post is a reflection but also a reflection and time capsule of my current professional and personal interests. And entirely self-satisfying.

I hope that this helps you learn a little about me and perhaps inspires you on your own bookshelf/background journey.

## Shelf 1

Shelf 1 includes the Stormlight Archives Series by Brandon Sanderson:

- The Way of Kings
- Words of Radience
- Oathbringer
- Rythm of War

If you're looking for some long, high-fantasy, I can't recommend it enough.

This shelf also includes two copies of The Little Prince, one in English and another in French.

On top of the books is a tiny globe and a ceramic turtle my brother got me from China.

Finally, I have a small replica of my favorite statue: The Winged Victory of Somrace. You can find the real Winged Victory in the Louvre. The pin right below it represents the right wing of the winged victory statue.

## Shelf 2

The next shelf has one of my favorite pictures with my twin sister. This was taken at the Chapel in Paris, France.

The two books on this shelf are Human = Machine by Paul Daugherty and H. James Wells and a leatherbound edition of Warbreaker by Brandon Sanderson.

The center includes a light-up L, my medallion from graduating from the University of Washington's Information School with a BS in Informatics, and a needle-felted raccoon I made.

## Shelf 3

Shelf 3 has the three books in the Art Behind How to Train Your Dragon series. This is my favorite animated series of all time, and I highly recommend rewatching the movies if you haven't in a while. I'd love to hear what you think about them.

In front of the book is my GitHub skyline from 2020, 3D printed in my favorite color: green.

On top of the books is a giant kusudama ball my sister folded, a cute ceramic fox, and a Doomslug and Oathbringer pin. A Doomslug is an adorable creature from the only series I haven't yet read by Brandon Sanderson: Skyward.

On the right front of this shelf are two Lego Porsche 911s. The white one is the standard one you can purchase. I special-ordered all of the red pieces so I could build a custom red one for myself. If you look closely, you can see a tiny lego minifigure modeled after myself. I am wearing a Porsche shirt and special-ordered the braid used in Elsa's minifigure to complete the look.

Finally, the globe is very special because it contains gold pins for the places I have personally travelled to and black pins for the physical places I have virtually given talks at.

# Shelf 4

For my college graduation, my family got me this Lego Porsche 911. I have currently built it in the Targa. If it isn't clear as of right now, I would one day love to buy my own life-size Porsche!

Behind the Porsche is a cool hourglass that reminded me of a time-turner and an award I earned from the University of Washington.

THis shelf also includes my favorite "professional" books: Bite-Sized Python by April Speight, Hit Refresh by Satya Nadella, a photo album, and How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie.

The heart is a keychain I purchased at, and the owl is the oldest piece on my bookshelf: a paper weight I got (and still like) from Elementary School.

# Shelf 5

Shelf 5 contains a bunch of books. From the inheritance series, we have:

- Eragon by Christopher Paolini
- Eldest by Christopher Paolini
- Brisingr by Christopher Paolini
- Inheritance by Christopher Paolini

The other two books are:

- The Business Value of

Last fall, I learned how to make my very own warm Butterbeer. Unfortunately, I lost the recipe I found online, so I decided to recreate it to the best of my ability on my personal blog so that I'll never lose it again.

With that said, here's my delicious and easy warm Butterbeer recipe:

## Ingredients for ~5 people

- 2 bottles of Non-Alchoholic Flying Cauldron Butterscoth Beer
- 3 cups of milk
- 3/4 cups of brown sugar
- 6 tablespoons of butter
- Whipped Cream (optional)

_Note: the Flying Cauldron Butterscotch Beer can likely be substituded for Cream Soda and Butterscotch Syrup._

## Directions

1. In a large cauldron (aka pot), add the brown sugar, butter, and milk and turn the stove to medium heat.
2. After the butter has completely melted, add the Flying Cauldron Butterscotch Beer.
3. Once the butterbeer is warm, serve with a dallop of whipped cream.
4. Enjoy! Watch out because the butterbeer and mugs usually get very hot!
